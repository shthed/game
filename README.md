A sandbox-friendly Babylon.js exploration demo with procedural terrain and instanced foliage.

## Usage

1. Start a static web server in this directory, e.g. with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
3. Drag the left mouse button to look around and use **WASD / Arrow keys** to move. Hold the right mouse button to walk forward, or use the on-screen touch controls on mobile.
4. Configure graphics, controls, and world options through the in-game **Options** button. Settings and world seeds persist in local storage.

Babylon.js loads from a CDN; no build step or install is required.
