# game

A minimal web-based 3D exploration game engine built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Usage

1. Start a static web server in this directory, e.g. with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
3. Click the page to lock the pointer, then use **WASD** to move and the mouse to look around.

No build step or install is required; the project uses Three.js from a CDN.
